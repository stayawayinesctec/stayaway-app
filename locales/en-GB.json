The app continuously checks whether compatible signals transmitted by other mobile phones are being received. If the proximity to another mobile phone is two metres or less, the app stores the other device’s current identification code, the signal strength, the date and the estimated duration of contact. The estimation of proximity relies on the strength of the signals received. In addition, the app periodically retrieves a list of the private keys of users known to be diagnosed with the COVID-19, and uses these to determine the associated identification codes. It compares these identification codes with those that it has stored locally. If this matching process indicates proximity of two metres or less, to at least one diagnosed user’s mobile phone, and if the sum of the duration of said proximity events in one day is 15 minutes, then the app issues a notification.\n\n"
